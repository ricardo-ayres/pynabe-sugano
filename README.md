    Pynabe-sugano is a python script that automates calculations involving 
    tanabe-sugano diagrams

  The task of finding the ratio of the heights of two lines with a ruler and
then determining the x and y intercepts in Tanabe-Sugano diagrams is tedious
and slow. This script utilizes 'diagrams' in the form of tables and searches
for the ratio automatically and then calculates the B Racah parameter and 10Dq.
