# pynabe-sugano
Python script that automates calculations involving Tanabe-Sugano diagrams

  The task of finding the ratio of the heights of two lines with a ruler and then determining the x and y intercepts in Tanabe-Sugano diagrams is tedious and slow. This script utilizes 'diagrams' in the form of tables and searches for the ratio automatically and then calculates the B Racah parameter and 10Dq.
